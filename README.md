# Jump Boy
<div>Beginning with a can I do this project. It became rather fun to continue.<br>

I have never played Super Meat Boy. Controls are basic as WASD movement and Space to jump. <br>

Built using Unity 2018.2f<br> </div>

WARNING: There is a bug that causes the build of the game to not accept any collision so the player infinitly falls.
